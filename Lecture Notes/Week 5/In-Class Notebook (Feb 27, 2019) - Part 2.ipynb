    "- Missing or incorrectly placed parentheses\n",
    "- Missing colons\n",
    "- Having a return in the wrong level of indentation in a for-loop or function\n",

Many other terms exist for this technique, often involving different inanimate objects. (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber_duck_debugging)\n",
