The menu is prix fix, so they must choose from an appetizer (soup or salad), a main course (beef, chicken or fish), and a dessert (cake or ice cream). Every table has 8 seats. At any given table, your server must go around and ask what each patron wants to eat. The tables are scattered, but are identifiable by a U.S. City. Food is delivered one table at a time, so it's important to keep track of things to facilitate this."
