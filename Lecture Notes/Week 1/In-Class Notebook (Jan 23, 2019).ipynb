In the original `print(\"Hello World\")` command you wrote, \"Hello World\" is considered a string value.

For instance, you will occasionally want to store a string that contains an apostrophe. In this case, it is most convenient to just choose double quotes to encapsulate your string and use your apostrophe inside of that string. (e.g. \"This is Jason's Computer\")"

The key can be considered a sort of \"address\" and the value being the Python object you are trying to retrieve. In a list the \"address\" is the index of the value. Dictionaries have the following characteristics:\n",
    "- Keys must be of one of the \"hashable\" types (Integer, float, string, tuple, None)\n",
    "- The keys are the equivalent of a set in that they are a hashed index that is unordered\n",
    "- \"Values\" can be of any data type (similar to a list)\n",

    "- Efficiently storing values in an easy-to-find place\n",
    "- Being able to name the location of where your values are located\n",
